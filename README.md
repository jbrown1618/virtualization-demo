## Virtualization Demo

A small app meant to explain the concept of virtualization and illustrate the difference between scrolling through a full list and scrolling through a virtualized list.

Some of the code is very similar to how GitHub virtualizes the code view, but some is artificial because we are scrolling relative to an overlaid rectangle rather than the actual viewport.
